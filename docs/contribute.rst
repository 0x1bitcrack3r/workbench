Git Development Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We're going to use the 'GitHub Flow' model.

-  To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
   master (ie:new-oauth2-scopes)
-  Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the
   same named branch on the server
-  When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for
   merging, open a pull request
-  After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you
   can merge it into master

Git Example
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ git checkout -b my-awesome
    $ git push -u origin my-awesome
    $ <code for a bit>; git push
    $ <code for a bit>; git push
    $ Go to github and hit 'New pull request'
