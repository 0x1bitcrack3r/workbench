#### Git Development Model
We're going to use the 'GitHub Flow' model.

- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie:new-oauth2-scopes)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master

#### Git Example
    $ git checkout -b my-awesome
    $ git push -u origin my-awesome
    $ <code for a bit>; git push
    $ <code for a bit>; git push
    $ Go to github and hit 'New pull request'
